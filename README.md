# üí∞ Zava Accounts Receivable - AR Management System

**Zava AR Management System** is an interactive web application designed to manage accounts receivable for the fictitious company Zava. This application demonstrates how SQL-based databases are leveraged across different types of workloads: **OLTP**, **OLAP**, and **AI-driven analysis** in the context of vendor invoice management and payment processing.

Through a hands-on interface, users can manage vendor information, track invoices, process payments, and use natural language to query accounts receivable data with AI assistance.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dashboard**: A central hub to view outstanding receivables, vendor status, and navigate the application.
- **Invoice Management (OLTP)**: View and track all vendor invoices with real-time status updates. This demonstrates a typical high-volume, read-heavy OLTP workload.
- **Payment Processing (OLTP)**: Process payments against invoices and manage vendor payment histories. This showcases a classic atomic, write-heavy OLTP operation that must be fast and reliable.
- **AR Analytics (OLAP)**: Explore an analytics dashboard with charts and summaries of receivables aging, vendor payment patterns, and cash flow trends. This represents an OLAP workload, running complex, aggregate queries over a large dataset.
- **AI Agent (AI Workload)**: 
    - Ask questions about your receivables in plain English (e.g., "Which vendors have overdue invoices over $5,000?"). An AI agent translates your question into a SQL query, executes it, and returns the answer.
    - Get support with AR processes using RAG over company documents
    - Process payments, update vendor information in plain English through an action-oriented data agent

## üöÄ Getting Started - Run locally

### üîß Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.9 or later)
- An [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/) account with an Entra ID application registered
- An [Azure OpenAI API Key](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service)
- ODBC Driver for SQL Server 18
- Recommend VSCode as tested in VS Code only

---

### üìÖ 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arno756/Banking_App_SQL.git
cd Banking_App_SQL
```

### üóÑÔ∏è 2. Set Up the Database

a. Create a database called ##zava_ar_system##.

b. The schema.sql file in the **backend** repository contains all the necessary T-SQL commands to create the required tables (vendors, invoices, payments, vendor_requests) and populate them with sample data.

You can execute this script against your Azure SQL Database using tools like VS Code Extension, SSMS, SQL Editor in Azure Portal or the sqlcmd command-line utility.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Configure the Backend (Flask API)

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` directory:

```env
DB_SERVER="<YOUR_AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING_URI.database.windows.net>"
DB_DATABASE="banking_app"
DB_DRIVER="ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server"

AZURE_CLIENT_ID="<YOUR_AZURE_CLIENT_ID>"
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="<YOUR_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET>"
AZURE_TENANT_ID="<YOUR_AZURE_TENANT_ID>"

AZURE_OPENAI_KEY="<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>"
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="<YOUR_OPENAI_ENDPOINT.openai.azure.com/>"
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4.1-mini
AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT=text-embedding-ada-002

```

### üíª 4. Configure the Frontend (React + Vite)

From the root project directory:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 5. Run Jupyter Notebook to create embeddings from the PDF Document

You need to ingest embeddings from the PDF in the SQL Database

a. Copy the .env file in the folder **Data_Ingest**.
b. From the folder **Data_Ingest** create a new virtual Python environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv new_env
source new_env/bin/activate  # Or .\new_env\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

c. Open the Jupyter Python Notebook in the path: Backend/Documentation ingestion_pdf_Bank_App.ipynb

d. Run all the cells in the notebook

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 6. Run the Application

#### Terminal 1: Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 app.py
```

Backend will run on: [http://127.0.0.1:5001](http://127.0.0.1:5001)

#### Terminal 2: Start Frontend

Go to the root of your folder.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend will run on: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
